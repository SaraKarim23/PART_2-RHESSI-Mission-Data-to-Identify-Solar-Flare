# PART_2-RHESSI-Mission-Data-to-Identify-Solar-Flare-Peak-Times
Analyzing a dataset of solar flares and Performs various data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization steps to explore the characteristics of solar flares.

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - The code reads the flare data from a CSV file and parses date and time columns into datetime objects.
   - It drops unnecessary columns and renames several columns for clarity.

2. **Data Exploration and Analysis:**
   - It calculates the sum of total counts for each year and month, providing insights into the yearly and monthly distribution of solar flares.
   - The code also counts the number of flares within different energy ranges.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The code creates several visualizations to explore relationships between various flare attributes:
     - A pairplot visualizes the relationships between flare duration, peak count rate, and total count with respect to energy.
     - Density plots and countplots show the distribution of flares across different energy ranges.
     - A histogram and density curve depict the distribution of flare durations.
     - A jointplot explores the relationship between radial values and total counts.
     - A violin plot shows the relationship between energy and the logarithm of flare duration.
     - A line plot visualizes the trend of solar flares per year from 2002 to 2016.

4. **Interpretation:**
   - Based on the visualizations, the code draws conclusions about the characteristics of solar flares in the dataset.
   - It observes that most flares occur in the energy range of 6-12 KeV and that short-duration flares tend to have higher energy density.
   - The code also notes the yearly and monthly distribution of flares and provides insights into the overall trends observed in the data.
